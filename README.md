# parser-playground
[Parser playground app](https://iamsmkr.github.io/parser-playground/) to demo usage of Scala library in javascript ecosystem using Scala.js

## Dev
1. To generate a fast optimized compiled version of the javascript file execute following command from Scala.js sbt plugin. The target file is generated under `js/target/scala-2.12` directory.

  ```
  $ sbt> fastOptJS
  ```

2. Access `index-dev.html` on your browser to launch the app

## Deploy
1. To generate fully optimized version of the javascript file execute the following command from Scala.js sbt plugin. The target file is generated under `js/target/scala-2.12` directory. Note that this can take a while on a larger project (tens of seconds), which is why we typically donâ€™t use fullOptJS during development. 

  ```
  $ sbt> fullOptJS
  ```

2. Access `index.html` on your browser to launch the app
